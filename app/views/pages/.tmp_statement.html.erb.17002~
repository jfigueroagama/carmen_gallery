	Through my work, I explore deeply personal and private thoughts that are common to us all:
	How we sense our material being, the sensory experiences absorbed through the body and the
	interaction of the physical along with the non physical way in which we sense ourselves, 
	such as:Â longings for what is lost, internal dialogues about how people interact 
	with each other, secret meanings and intentions that remain unspoken.
</p>
<p>
	Through the modification of the human body and the surroundings, full with metaphorical settings,
	I seek to render the unseen to approximate a more personally accurate and intimate 
	representation of reality and what is absent in a visual way but nevertheless affects
	the way we inhabit our lives. 
</p>
<p>
	The element of the unknown and sometimes invisible is always present, creating tension 
	and infusing the imaginery with a sort of mysticism, all dictated by what is veiled in the 
	unconscious part of the brain, the dreams that infect the waking life with indecipherable 
	messages, the perception of time in a non-lineal way and the true understanding of 
	mortality; is death what ejects us from the physical world into the unknown and 
	ends the relationship with this reality.  
</p>
<p>
	This focuses my work into a meticulous balancing act of representing what we know 
	to be there but cannot be seen.
