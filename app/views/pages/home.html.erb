	CARMEN FIGUEROA is a NYC based artist originally from Mexico City, where the rich culture became
	a mayor influence in her visual language. She grew up surrounded by the overwhelming baroque
	tradition in arquitecture that survives from the colonial era, as well as, the famous murals by
	Diego Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros and the gritty underground urban art culture.
	As a teenager she started her Fine Arts Education in the Mexican Fine Arts Institute where only
	few students are admitted each year; there she explored her interest in subcultures through her
	art and showed her work often in group and individual exhibits. She received various awards
	from the Mexican National Fine Arts Institute.
	At 22, she moved to NYC to persue a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts and develop her career in
	the NYC art world. She recently obtained a MFA Degree from Brooklyn College School of Art,
	where she focused in advanced printmaking techniques.
